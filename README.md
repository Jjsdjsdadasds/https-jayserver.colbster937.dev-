# Brickia
Brickia's source code. Some aspects may be left out due to me just not wanting to include them. Don't ask for them either, I won't supply them. <br> 
I also WILL NOT assist with the creations of clones using this code so again do not ask. <br> 
Make sure to also check out the MIT license that comes with this. <br>

Lastly, Fair warning that this code is <b> very </b> buggy and if used requires a lot of fixing! <br> <br>
